Reading Material
Read through the examples in these two articles about [`for` loops](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-construct-for-loops-in-python-3) and [`while` loops](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-construct-while-loops-in-python-3) from Digital Ocean. Then, answer the following questions.



1. What is a nested loop?

A nested loop is a loop within a loop


2. Which kind of loop is based on a conditional statement: `while` loops or `for` loops?

While loops are based on conditional statements


3. When you want to iterate a specific number of times, would you typically use a `while` loop or a `for` loop?

Would use a for loop


4. Is it possible to loop through a string one letter at a time? What is the example given in the article?

Yes, it is possible. The example given is:

sammy = "Sammy"
for letter in sammy:
    print(letter)


5. Extrapolate from what you learned in the articles: Do you think a `for` loop be nested inside a `while` loop? Why or why not?

I think a for loop can be nested inside a while loop. The for loop will only trigger if the conditions for the while loop are met
